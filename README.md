# Stargazing Forecast

This is a Next.js stargazing forecast project. Users can type a location and date and get a rating of the stargazing quality (Good/Moderate/Poor). The [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API is used for weather data and the [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/) API is used for geocoding the location the user inputs.

## Testing

For Playwright tests:
